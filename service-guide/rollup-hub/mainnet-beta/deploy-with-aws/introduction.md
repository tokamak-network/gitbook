### **Deploying the Thanos Chain with the Thanos Stack**

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for deploying the Thanos chain using the Thanos stack, a robust, AWS-optimized infrastructure designed for seamless blockchain operations. With its streamlined configuration and deployment process, the Thanos stack leverages AWS services to ensure scalability, reliability, and efficiency.

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up and deploy the Thanos chain by following a structured approach. From preparing your environment with the necessary tools to provisioning infrastructure using Terraform, each section provides clear instructions and configurations tailored for operators.

The deployment process involves several key phases:

1. **Prerequisites**: Set up the required tools, operator accounts, L1 RPC and AWS IAM user with AdministratorAccess to configure the Thanos stack infrastructure using Terraform.
2. **Deploy contracts:** This section outlines the deployment of the Thanos chain, covering system contract deployment and generation of genesis and rollup files
3. **Building AWS infra with terraform**: This guide covers setting up the Thanos stack infrastructure on AWS using Terraform
4. **Deploy Thanos chain:** This step involves deploying the Thanos chain using a Helm chart, simplifying the deployment process.

Each section includes step-by-step instructions, commands, and configurations, ensuring operators have a clear path to successful deployment. Additionally, the guide highlights best practices, such as cost optimization and monitoring strategies, to streamline operations and ensure stability.

By following this guide, operators can efficiently deploy and manage the Thanos chain, leveraging the scalability and reliability of the Thanos stack on AWS. Let's get started!
