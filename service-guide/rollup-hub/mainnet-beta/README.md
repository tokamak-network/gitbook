# Mainnet Beta

#### This guide focuses on deploying Tokamak Rollup Hub in a Mainnet environment.&#x20;

Mainnet Beta is a comprehensive guide to deploying and running your own Appchain on the Mainnet using the infrastructure of your preference. Before deploying Appchain directly to the mainnet, you'll need to fix possible errors and test it sufficiently for production.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to test in a Testnet environment before deploying to the mainnet, you can do so directly with Thanos Sepolia. Please see [here](https://docs.tokamak.network/home/service-guide/tokamak-l2/thanos-stack/testnet-information) for more information.
