# Deployment Configuration Parameters

* **Network Name**: Use the name of the Appchain to distinguish it from other networks. If you have a name of your own, please write it down, and make sure it's in alphabetical order with no spaces or numbers.
* **Chain ID:** It is an important factor in identifying blockchain networks, representing the unique characteristics of each network. This can help facilitate the process of transaction validation. For example, chain IDs can be used to verify that transactions made on a particular blockchain are processed according to that network's rules and protocols. This is essential to ensure the integrity and safety of transactions. You can register your own network on ChainList to use the chain ID, just make sure that it doesn't overlap with other networks.
* **Native Token**: In Layer 2, a native token refers to the primary token used within that specific Layer 2 network. For your rollup, you can designate any ERC-20 token as the native token, including protocol tokens or stablecoins. Please note that there are some conditions to be met and you can view it [here](https://www.notion.so/tokamak/1-Overview-137d96a400a380ce9d38e73035fbeaca?pvs=4#12fd96a400a38168af40f6ff221da460).
  * There are a few conditions for Native Token:
    * The token's contract address must be in L1 (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Ethereum Sepolia testnet)
    * It must be valid ERC-20 and have 18 decimals
    * It must not have rebasing capabilities
* **Admin Address**: This address has the authority to control key parameters and manage smart contracts within the rollup network. It's essential to have an entity that can manage or modify certain functions of the network in case of upgrades or emergencies (e.g., bug fixes or security issues)
* **Sequencer Address**: Determines the order of transactions and processes them within the rollup network. It defines the ordering of transactions, ensuring the sequence in which transactions are processed is clear, thus enabling high-speed processing within the rollup network. Sequencers are often run on centralized nodes, but they play a critical role in ensuring fast transaction processing and low latency in the network.
* **Batcher Address**: Responsible for bundling multiple transactions into a batch and submitting them to the L1 chain. Rollups process many transactions cheaply by bundling them together for batch processing. The Batcher is responsible for efficiently creating these bundles and submitting them to the main chain. The batcher optimizes transaction grouping and compression to minimize gas costs, which is crucial for the cost-efficiency of rollups.
* **Proposer Address**: Responsible for proposing blocks generated within the rollup to the main chain. The proposer handles block generation and validation, ensuring that the state changes (e.g., transaction results) in the rollup are reflected on the L1 chain. In solutions like ZK rollups or Optimistic rollups, the proposer plays a crucial role in generating and submitting rollup blocks to the L1 chain. Once the proposer submits a block, it gets verified on the L1 chain, ensuring the rollupâ€™s state is securely recorded.
* **Challenger Address:** This address is the address of a smart contract or entity used to validate or challenge invalid state transitions or inaccurate data on Layer 2. This address is responsible for verifying that the transactions executed in the Appchain or Layer 2 were processed correctly, and reporting back to the Layer 1 chain if it finds an issue.
