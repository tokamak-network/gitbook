# Discover (L2 Stack)

### Tokamak OP

Customized L2 stack built on Optimism, which offers fast and affordable computation and state updates by using optimistic rollup. Along with Optimismâ€™s capabilities, this stack also includes a flexible gas fee to enhance the user experience.

### Tokamak ZK+ _(Coming Soon)_

Cutting-edge virtual machine for L2, designed to work with zk-SNARKs. It supports a previously unseen L2 rollup architecture that reduces computational complexity without compromising security or privacy.\
Tokamak ZK+ is currently in development, and we'll be announcing information, including when it will be available to the public, soon.
