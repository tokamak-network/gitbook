#### **Essential Information**

The Discover page provides comprehensive details about deployed rollups on the Tokamak Network, including Tokamak OP, and Tokamak ZK+. This valuable information empowers users to gain insights into the diverse rollup landscape and make informed decisions about their own rollup deployments.

#### **Key Information**

* **Rollup Name** : Use the name of the rollup to distinguish it from other networks. If you have a name of your own, please write it down, and make sure it's in alphabetical order with no spaces or numbers.
* **RPC(Remote Procedure Call)** : An RPC address is an API endpoint that allows interaction with a blockchain node.
  * **Communication with the Blockchain Network**
    * Through the RPC address, you can connect to a blockchain node and perform various tasks such as sending transactions, calling smart contracts, and retrieving account information.
  * **Interacting with Node Data**
    * RPC enables clients (wallets, DApps, users) to request a blockchain node to perform specific actions using a function call method. The blockchain node processes this request and returns the results to the client.
    * Common RPC requests include querying the network status, retrieving specific transaction details, reading block data, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts.
  * **Different RPC Addresses Based on Network Type**
    * **Mainnet** : The live blockchain network where actual transactions occur.
    * **Testnet** : Networks used for development and testing purposes (e.g., Ethereum's Sepolia, Goerli, etc.).
    * **Private Nodes** : Nodes operated by an individual (e.g., a locally running Ethereum node or Ganache).
* **Chain ID :** It is an important factor in identifying blockchain networks, representing the unique characteristics of each network. This can help facilitate the process of transaction validation. For example, chain IDs can be used to verify that transactions made on a particular blockchain are processed according to that network's rules and protocols. This is essential to ensure the integrity and safety of transactions. You can find Thanos Sepolia's chain ID at this [ChainList link](https://chainlist.org/?search=thanos). You can use this, or you can register your own network on ChainList to use the chain ID, just make sure that it doesn't overlap with other networks.
* **Settlement Layer** : The settlement layer is the base layer of a blockchain, which is responsible for validating transactions. Many sidechains or blockchain layers can be built on top of it. For example, Ethereum works as a settlement layer, and the Tokamak Network's Thanos is a layer 2 solution to offload the processing speed and gas costs of the Ethereum mainnet.
* **DA Layer** : The Data Availability Layer is a critical component in modern blockchain architecture, particularly for Layer 2 scaling solutions. Its main purpose is to ensure that all the necessary data for validating transactions is available and can be accessed by network participants. By providing a reliable way to verify off-chain data, the DAL helps maintain the security and integrity of the blockchain while significantly improving its scalability. In traditional blockchain setups, all transaction data is stored directly on-chain, which can quickly become a bottleneck as the network grows. The DAL addresses this issue by enabling more efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
* **Native Token** : In Layer 2, a native token refers to the token primarily used within that specific Layer 2 network. While Layer 2s often interact closely with Layer 1's native tokens, some Layer 2 solutions also issue their own native tokens. The key roles of Native Tokens are as follows
  * **Gas Fee Payment** : Native tokens are primarily used to pay for **gas fees** when processing transactions or executing smart contracts on Layer 2. These transactions typically require significantly lower gas fees than on the main chain, and the native tokens cover these costs.
  * **Governance Participation** : In some Layer 2 networks, holders of native tokens have the right to participate in network governance. This means they can vote on key decisions such as network upgrades, fee policies, and sequencer operations.
  * **Incentive Mechanism** : Native tokens can also be used as rewards and incentives to encourage participation in the Layer 2 network. For example, participants or liquidity providers can be rewarded with native tokens.
* **Block Explorer :** It is a powerful tool for monitoring and analyzing the activity of a blockchain network. You can view block information, look up transaction history, and even look up specific wallet addresses. It also allows you to visualize blockchain data. With these features, Block Explorer is used by developers, researchers, investors, and other stakeholders to monitor and analyze blockchain networks
* **Contract Addresses :** The unique addresses of smart contracts associated with the rollup, allowing for direct interaction and integration.
  * **Admin Address** : This address has the authority to control key parameters and manage smart contracts within the rollup network. It's essential to have an entity that can manage or modify certain functions of the network in case of upgrades or emergencies (e.g., bug fixes or security issues)
  * **Sequencer Address** : Determines the order of transactions and processes them within the rollup network. It defines the ordering of transactions, ensuring the sequence in which transactions are processed is clear, thus enabling high-speed processing within the rollup network. Sequencers are often run on centralized nodes, but they play a critical role in ensuring fast transaction processing and low latency in the network.
  * **Batcher Address** : Responsible for bundling multiple transactions into a batch and submitting them to the L1 chain. Rollups process many transactions cheaply by bundling them together for batch processing. The Batcher is responsible for efficiently creating these bundles and submitting them to the main chain. The batcher optimizes transaction grouping and compression to minimize gas costs, which is crucial for the cost-efficiency of rollups.
  * **Proposer Address** : Responsible for proposing blocks generated within the rollup to the main chain. The proposer handles block generation and validation, ensuring that the state changes (e.g., transaction results) in the rollup are reflected on the L1 chain. In solutions like ZK rollups or Optimistic rollups, the proposer plays a crucial role in generating and submitting rollup blocks to the L1 chain. Once the proposer submits a block, it gets verified on the L1 chain, ensuring the rollupâ€™s state is securely recorded.
* **Faucet :** A service that provides free tokens for testing purposes, promoting experimentation and innovation.
